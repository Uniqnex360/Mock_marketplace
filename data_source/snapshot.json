    "description": "Ease your aches and pains with the Biofreeze Professional roll on pain relief gel. Designed with chiropractors, and previously only used in clinical settings, this powerfull formula provides fast acting, long lasting pain relief for sore muscles and joints, simple backaches, arthritis, strains, bruises and sprains. Biofreeze Professional roll on is well-suited for mess-free application via roller ball on small and large muscle areas. Whether you need a fast acting formula to target your knee pain, neck pain, simple backache, shoulder pain, hip pain, arthritis pain, or pain during muscle recovery, look no further than Biofreeze. HOW DOES IT WORK? Pain happens when your receptors send a signal from your spine to your brain. Cold sensations, like menthol, stimulate receptors to block those signals to relieve pain. The fast acting, menthol based formula of Biofreeze provides powerful pain relief when directly applied to the skin. In a 2017 study, Biofreeze was 2x more effective than ice for reducing pain among a group of neck pain sufferers. Biofreeze offers a variety of pain relief formats to suit your lifestyle, such as pain relief patches, spray, cream, roll on, foam, and gel.
